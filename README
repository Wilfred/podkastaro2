Podkastaro 2 is a port of the original PHP Podkastaro to Django.

Podkastaro is a site that aggregates every Esperanto-language podcast
that I'm aware of. It uses feedparser to fetch the feeds and
BeautifulSoup to remove unwanted text in the descriptions.

The styling is a port of 2Plus, a blogger template developed by Dante
and Klodian.
